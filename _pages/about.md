Hi, I’m Nityaa—an AI researcher focused on NLP, explainable AI, responsible AI, and recommender systems. I enjoy building systems that make model behavior easier to audit and reason about.

- Currently at Tilburg University, working on responsible ML and interpretability.
- Interested in how research ideas become reliable products and teaching materials.
- Writing about research practice, tooling, and the human side of AI work.

If you want to collaborate or chat, reach me at `n.kalra@tilburguniversity.edu` or on LinkedIn.
