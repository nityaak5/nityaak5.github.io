Hi, I’m Nityaa, an AI researcher working in natural language processing (NLP) with a strong focus on explainable, responsible, and ethical AI.

I am  interested in building and evaluating systems that make model behavior transparent, interpretable, and easier to audit, especially in high-stakes or socially sensitive settings.

I am  currently at Tilburg University, where I work on designing small language models and LLM fairness. My master thesis was about thematic bias in book recommender systems. Feel free to check it out [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15643).

More broadly, my interests include:
- Ethical and responsible AI practices across the ML lifecycle
- Explainability and interpretability for NLP models
- Understanding and mitigating bias in data and models
- The human side of AI work, including how models are used and understood in practice

I occasionally write about research workflows, projects I build, and lessons learned from applied ML research.
If you would like to collaborate or chat, feel free to reach out!
