Notes on prompts I’m using to pressure-test new ideas:

- “What would make this claim obviously false?” to surface brittle assumptions.
- “If I had to teach this in 10 slides, which slide is weakest?” to prioritize clarity.
- “What signal do I need before running another experiment?” to avoid busywork.

Capturing these in a notebook keeps the thinking honest.
