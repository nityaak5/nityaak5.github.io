Sketching how I plan to combine model interpretability research with practical tooling. The short version:

- Map current work on faithful rationales and counterfactuals to a few open datasets I trust.
- Build a lightweight evaluation loop that measures brittleness over time, not just single snapshots.
- Document failure cases and push them into teaching material so others can reuse them.

I’ll share experiments monthly to keep momentum visible and invite feedback.
