Rotating themes weekly (research, teaching, reading, rest) keeps me from overfitting to one lane. When I plan my week this way I:

- Protect two evenings for reading that isn’t directly tied to work.
- Leave one block for low-stakes experiments that may fail.
- Track mood and energy alongside output to see where the friction really is.

It’s a reminder that pace and variety matter as much as raw hours.
